## About me
I have started my frontend journey with free online courses from HTML Academy in 2018.  
Since that I have used several resources (YouTube videos, online books) to develop my skills and self-learning helped me to find my very first job in IT.  
Currently I am working remotely in a small international company as a project manager and junior frontend-developer.  
I am willing to develop my frontend skills at RS-School and apply them to my working process.

## Skills
* HTML + CSS (SCSS/LESS)
